# Cash-Flow-Minimizer


Implemented a system that optimizes transactional efficiency between diverse global banks with varying payment methods, streamlining the process and minimizing the number of transactions required. Utilized a centralized world bank, equipped with multiple payment modes, as an intermediary to facilitate seamless transactions among banks lacking a shared payment method.

This system is completely menu-driven. So when you will run the C Application, it will guide you and show you the final output.
